# CompetitionRegistrationSystem

This is an online system for team competition. `Register`, `Information Check`, `Login` and `File Upload` functions provided.

I'm a almost zero-based front end and entry-level back end, and was forced to write this system.

Above all, there are lots of code which are not elegant and I belive all the codes I wrote in this system are just a mess of shit, haha.

The front end code will be uploaded later after I finished organizing the codes, and back end code will be uploaded after the competition is over, in consideration for security.
