# CompetitionRegistrationSystem

### Brief Introduction

This is an online system for team competition. `Register`, `Login`, `Information Check`, `File Upload` and `Forum` functions provided.

I am a newbie in both front-end developing and back-end developing, and was therefore forced to write this system with lots of inelegant code. Writing these inelegant code makes me feel really excited.

By the way, I did't mean I want to be a full-stack web developer in the far future, I generally writes naive back-end code, studying and interested in this filed although I am still an entry-level novice.

Above all, the code I wrote in this system are just a mess of shit, haha.

### The interface of this project is based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) Front-end Framework, and it is my first time to use Front-end Framework.

The front-end code will be uploaded later after finishing organizing them, and the back-end code will be uploaded after the competition is over, in consideration for security.
